HOW ARRAYS WORK (Core Concept)

An array:

Stores elements of SAME type

Stored in CONTIGUOUS memory

Has FIXED size

Provides O(1) access by index

Why O(1)?

Because:
address = base_address + (index × size_of_element)

So JVM directly calculates memory location.

Example:

int[] arr = new int[5];

Memory:
Index: 0 1 2 3 4
Value: 0 0 0 0 0

Default value of int = 0
